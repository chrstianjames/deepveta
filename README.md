Usage of DeepVeta
Basic Example
Here's a quick example of how to use DeepVeta for a simple data analysis task:

import deepveta as dv
import pandas as pd

# Load your data
data = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")

# Initialize DeepVeta
analyzer = dv.DeepVetaAnalyzer(data)

# Preprocess the data
preprocessed_data = analyzer.preprocess()

# Perform pattern analysis
patterns = analyzer.find_patterns(preprocessed_data)
print("Discovered patterns by DeepVeta:", patterns)

# Build a predictive model (example: classification)
model = analyzer.build_model(preprocessed_data, target_column="your_target")
predictions = model.predict(preprocessed_data)
print("Predictions by DeepVeta:", predictions)

# Visualize results
analyzer.visualize_data(preprocessed_data)
analyzer.visualize_model_performance(model)
